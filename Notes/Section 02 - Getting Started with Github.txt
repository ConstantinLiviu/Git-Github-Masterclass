14. Pushing your Local Repo to GitHub

Add local repository to github repository:
git command:
git remote add origin <repository link/ssh> (add remote repository we're linking to; origin stands for the repo link)
git push origin <branch name> (push to remote repository)

********************************************************************
16. Pulling from the remote

Sync local repository to remote
git command:
git pull origin *(referring to repo link)* <branch name>

tracking = local branch is going to be tracking a remote branch
to set tracking, git command:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<remote repo branch name> (branch name referrs to the one on the remote repo; i.e. origin/master referrs to the entire path of the branch we want to track) <local branch> (name of the branchy that will track the remote branch)

with tracking in place, we simplyfy the syncing repository
git command: 
git pull

********************************************************************
17. Check for changes with Git Status

to check for updates, git command:
git fetch -> creates a local copy of the remote repo that is not immediately availabe
git status -> compares local repo to fetched copy, displaying differences, if any, between the two

(git pull is two commands in one - it first fetches the repository and then it merges the files)

git restore -> discard changes in working directory
